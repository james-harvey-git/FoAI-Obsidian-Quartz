For a set of observed data $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$, the empirical distribution for the data is given by $$p(x)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\delta(x-x_i)$$
i.e. each point is assigned equal probability. Remember this is for the *empirical* distribution and so this is technically true just from looking at the data points.

By [[The Law of Large Numbers]], this empirical distribution will converge to the true distribution in the limit $n \rightarrow \infty$.
