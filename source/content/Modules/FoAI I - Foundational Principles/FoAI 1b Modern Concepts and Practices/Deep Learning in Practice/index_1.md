# Deep Learning in Practice (Module 1b)

This folder will contain notes from the **Deep Learning in Practice** sessions scheduled for 30 and 31 October 2025.  The lectures will focus on the practical aspects of training and deploying neural networks, covering data preprocessing, optimisation algorithms, regularisation techniques, model selection, and engineering considerations.

Once the lectures have taken place and slides become available, detailed notes will be added here.
