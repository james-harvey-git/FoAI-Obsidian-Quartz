## 🧭 Overview
This lecture introduces **Large Language Models (LLMs)** as next-token predictors that model language through **autoregressive probability factorization**. It traces the shift from **Shannon’s memorization-based models** to **neural approaches** that generalize via **compression and pattern learning**. Key topics include **tokenization with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**, the **Transformer architecture** (embeddings, attention, residuals), and **text generation methods** such as temperature and top-k/p sampling. It concludes with **post-training alignment**—notably **RLHF**, framed as **Bayesian inference** aligning model behavior with human preferences.
