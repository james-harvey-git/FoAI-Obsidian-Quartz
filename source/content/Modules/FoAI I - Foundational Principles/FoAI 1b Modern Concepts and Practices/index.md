# Module 1b – Advanced Models & Practice

Module 1b complements the theory of Module 1a by focusing on modern practical approaches to machine learning and artificial intelligence.  The topics cover generative models, hands‑on deep‑learning practices, large language models and reinforcement learning.  At this early stage only the timetable is available; detailed notes will be added as the lectures occur.

## Topics

The module is organised into the following themes:

* **[[Modules/FoAI I - Foundational Principles/FoAI 1b Modern Concepts and Practices/Diffusion Models/index|Diffusion Models]]** – generative models based on iterative noise removal.  Notes will be added after the lecture on 23 October.
* **[[index_1|Deep Learning in Practice]]** – practical issues and techniques in training deep neural networks (materials will be added after lectures on 30 and 31 October).
* **[[Modules/FoAI I - Foundational Principles/FoAI 1b Modern Concepts and Practices/Large Language Models/index|Large Language Models]]** – architectures and training strategies for state‑of‑the‑art language models (notes will be added after early November lectures).
* **[[Modules/FoAI I - Foundational Principles/FoAI 1b Modern Concepts and Practices/Reinforcement Learning/index|Reinforcement learning]]** – methods for sequential decision making and interaction with environments (to be added after mid‑November sessions).

Each topic folder currently contains a brief index file.  As slides and readings become available, more detailed notes will be added.
