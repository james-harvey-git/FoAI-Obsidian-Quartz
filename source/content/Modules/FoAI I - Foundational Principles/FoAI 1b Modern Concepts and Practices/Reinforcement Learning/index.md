# Reinforcement learning (Module 1b)

Reinforcement learning is about training agents to make sequences of decisions through interaction with an environment.  The two sessions planned for 13 and 14 November 2025 will likely cover fundamentals such as Markov decision processes, value functions, policy gradients and exploration strategies.

At present this page serves as a placeholder.  It will be expanded with lecture notes once the materials are available.
