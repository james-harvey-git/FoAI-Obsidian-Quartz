# Module 1a – Theory, Bayesian & Causal

Module&nbsp;1a introduces the theoretical underpinnings of machine learning and artificial intelligence.  It spans topics from classical learning theory through Bayesian inference and causal reasoning to the metrics used to evaluate machine‑learning models.  The module is taught during Michaelmas Term 2025, often alongside Module&nbsp;1b.

## Topics and Structure

The module is broken into several themes, each of which has its own folder in this vault:

* **[[Learning Theory/index|Learning Theory]]** – classical and modern theories of learnability, including the bias–variance/approximation–estimation distinction, empirical risk minimisation, PAC learning, VC dimension, double descent and PAC–Bayes theory.
* **[[Modules/FoAI I - Foundational Principles/FoAI 1a Fundamental Concepts/Bayesian Methods/index|Bayesian methods]]** – Bayesian approaches to inference and prediction (material to be added after lectures on 27 October and 11 November).
* **[[Modules/FoAI I - Foundational Principles/FoAI 1a Fundamental Concepts/Causal Methods/index|Causal methods]]** – foundations of causal inference, graphical models and causal discovery (material to be added after lectures on 3 and 4 November).
* **[[Modules/FoAI I - Foundational Principles/FoAI 1a Fundamental Concepts/Machine Learning Metrics/index|Machine‑learning metrics]]** – approaches to evaluating machine‑learning models beyond simple accuracy (material to be added after the 10 November lecture).

These folders contain `index.md` files that summarise the topic and link to more detailed pages.  Notes will be added as lectures take place.  For now, the **Learning Theory** folder contains detailed notes from the lecture on 22 October 2025.
