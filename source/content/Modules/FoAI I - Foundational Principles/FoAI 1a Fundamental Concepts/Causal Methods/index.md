# Causal methods (Module 1a)

The **causal methods** lectures (3 and 4 November 2025) will explore how to infer causal relationships from data.  Topics are likely to include causal diagrams, do‑calculus, identifiability, backdoor and frontdoor criteria, and modern approaches to causal discovery.

This folder currently contains only this overview.  Detailed notes will be added after the lectures, including links to further resources such as the *Causal Methods Course Materials*.
