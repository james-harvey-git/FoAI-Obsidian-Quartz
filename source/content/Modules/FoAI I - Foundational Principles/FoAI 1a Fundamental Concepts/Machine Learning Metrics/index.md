# Machine‑learning metrics (Module 1a)

This folder will house notes from the session on **Machine‑learning metrics** scheduled for 10 November 2025.  Evaluating machine‑learning models goes far beyond simple accuracy, especially when dealing with imbalanced data, probabilistic predictions or structured outputs.

The forthcoming lecture will likely cover precision, recall, F‑scores, ROC and PR curves, calibration, expected calibration error and other diagnostic measures.  Detailed notes and links to additional resources will be added here once the lecture has taken place.
