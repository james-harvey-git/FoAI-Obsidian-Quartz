# Fundamentals of AI CDT – Obsidian Vault

Welcome to the Obsidian vault for the **Fundamentals of AI** modules in the CDT DPhil.  
This vault is structured around the two concurrent modules – **Module&nbsp;1a** and **Module&nbsp;1b** – that make up the first part of the CDT program.  It contains summaries of lectures, key concepts and links between related ideas.  Feel free to explore the notes and follow the links between topics to build a connected understanding of the material.

## Modules

| Module | Focus | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **[[Module 1a/index|Module&nbsp;1a – Theory, Bayesian & Causal]]** | Foundations of machine‐learning theory, Bayesian inference, causal reasoning and evaluation metrics. | Contains detailed notes from the *Learning Theory* lecture, along with placeholders for upcoming lectures on Bayesian methods, causal methods and machine‑learning metrics. |
| **[[Module 1b/index|Module&nbsp;1b – Advanced Models & Practice]]** | Practical and modern machine‑learning topics including diffusion models, deep learning in practice, large language models and reinforcement learning. | At present there are only schedule summaries; content will be added as lectures occur. |

Each module has its own index file with a timetable and an overview of the topics it covers.  Within each module you will find subfolders for each topic.  The notes make extensive use of Obsidian’s wiki links (the `[[Link]]` syntax) to connect related concepts.  You can navigate using the **graph view** in Obsidian to see how ideas are linked.

### Adding Your Own Notes

This vault has been created as a starting point.  You can add your own annotations or extra references by editing the existing markdown files or creating new ones in the appropriate folders.  To link to another note, simply use the double bracket syntax.  If you annotate additional slides or readings, consider creating new sub‑pages under the relevant topic folder and linking them from the topic’s index file.
